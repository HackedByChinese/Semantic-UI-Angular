**Semantic-UI-Angular** is a pure AngularJS 1.x set of directives for Semantic-UI components.
As soon as Angular 2 will get better animations support, we will consider creating (or merging some existing project if there will be one) Angular 2 components as well.
We've decided to use TypeScript as a step to Angular 2 friendly environment.
